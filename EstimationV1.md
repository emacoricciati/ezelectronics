# Estimation approach
Consider the EZElectronics  project in CURRENT version (as given by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch
# Estimate by size

|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |  100                          |

# Summary

The estimate is different depending on the different approaches used. This difference could be explained by the fact that the estimate by size approach does not take into account the preliminary work but rather the efforts made in the coding phase. It is therefore the least precise approach to estimate the effort unlike the estimate by activity decomposition one.

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |50|Half a week
| estimate by product decomposition |104|4 days
| estimate by activity decomposition |115|4 days
